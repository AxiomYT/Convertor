# Convertor
A Python CLI script that converts units and soon to be the only tool any good HAM needs :)

Currently supports:

- [ ] Length - (mm, cm, m, km)
- [ ] Weight - (lbs, tn, g, kg, ug, mg)

# Planned updates

- [ ] Update Mass Conversion (imperial ton, us ton, stone, ounce)
- [ ] Update Length Conversion (micrometre, nanometre, mile, yard, foot, inch, nautical mile)
